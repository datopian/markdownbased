Welcome to this tutorial on how to push an Obsidian vault to a Github repository!

## Steps

### Step 1: Setting Up GitHub Desktop and GitHub Repository

1.1. If you haven't already done so, create a GitHub account at https://github.com

1.2. Download and install the GitHub Desktop app from https://desktop.github.com

1.3. Once installed, open the GitHub Desktop app. You'll be prompted to sign in with your GitHub account.

### Step 2: Setting Up Your Vault as a GitHub Repository

2.1. Click on "Add an Existing Repository from your Hard Drive"

2.2. Navigate to your Obsidian vault's folder using the file explorer.

2.3. You'll see a warning saying "This directory does not appear to be a Git repository. Would you like to create a repository here instead?" Click on the link "create a repository".

2.4. You'll be brought to the "Create a New Repository" page with the vault's location already in the "Local Path" box.

2.5. Choose a name for your repository. It's best to use lowercase and dashes. (For the sake of simplicity use the same or similar name to your vault's folder name.)

2.6. Add an optional description.

2.7. Make sure the checkbox "Initialize this repository with a README" is unchecked, and "Git Ignore" and "License" are set to "None".

2.8. Click on "Create Repository".

### Step 3: Pushing Your Vault to GitHub

3.1. You'll see a dashboard with the heading "No local changes". Below you'll see a suggestion with a button "Publish repository". Click on it. (You could also use "Publish repository" button in the top application bar.) 

3.2. A new window will appear. Choose a name (it will automatically suggest the one you chose during the creation process, and its best to leave it this way), add an optional description, and select whether you want it to be public or private.

> [!Important]
> Please be aware that if your GitHub repository is public, this process will make your Obsidian vault publicly accessible. If you wish to keep your vault private, you'll need to select "Private" when publishing the repository.

3.3. Click on "Publish Repository".

3.4. Wait for the process to complete. You'll see a small prompt when the upload is complete.

3.5. You can now visit your repository on GitHub's website to see your uploaded Obsidian vault.

Whenever you make changes to your Obsidian vault and you want to update those changes on GitHub, all you need to do is to commit and push those changes through the GitHub Desktop app.

> Here we should add a link to another How to, explaining the process of publishing changes made in the repo.
