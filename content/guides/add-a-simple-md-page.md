title: How to quickly add a simple Markdown-based page
---
Welcome to the How to quickly add a simple Markdown-based page for contributors and creators using github, obsidian, flowershow and markdown to create their websites. 

This guide is designed for non-technical contributors; there's no need to know how to code. 

This Howto is only recommended for very simple Markdown pages, e.g. those without images, links to other pages, diagrams, or other elements that don't render in GitHub preview mode. 

If you are planning to link to other pages from this page, embedding images and other interlinking actions, we recommend doing this locally in Obsidian, a Markdown editor. For how to do this you can view [this guide](details to be added)

## Steps
  
### Step 1  : Create the new page

1. Go to the location of the website repository in github and into the 'codes' section

2. Find and click on the `content` folder to open it. This is where all the Markdown files for the website content are stored and where you will be adding your file (page). If you need to add this within a subfolder in the content folder, find this folder and click on this as well.

3. Click “Add file”, add the page name + extension .md i.e. new-page-name.md

4. Paste or write the file using the md layout 

5. Preview

The following steps are the same as from the [Edit a single page how to](link)                                               
### Step 2: Save your changes

When you're happy with your edits, click on the “Commit changes” button. In the "Commit message" field, provide a concise summary of your changes. If necessary, you can add further explanation in the "Extended description" text field. Then select “Commit directly to the main branch”.

### Step 3: See your changes live

After committing your changes, these should be pushed through to the main site.

## Summary
Congratulations, you've now learned how to create a new page on your website. 

If anything is not clear to you, or you have suggestions on how we can make this 'How to' better, please don't hesitate to let us know. 

Happy editing!
