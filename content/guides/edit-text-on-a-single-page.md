title: How to quickly edit text content on a single Markdown-based page
---

Welcome to the How to edit a single page on your website. This is for contributors and creators using github, obsidian, flowershow and markdown to create their websites.

This guide is designed for non-technical contributors; there's no need to know how to code, and it is recommended for use on text based markdown pages only.

Remember, the content of the web pages in these How to's are written in Markdown. If you are unfamiliar with Markdown, check out [this short guide](https://flowershow.app/docs/syntax) on available syntax elements.


## Steps

### Step 1: Navigate to the underlying Markdown file and edit it

**Option A: Use "Edit this page" button**

Some pages on your website may have an "Edit this page" button at the bottom. By clicking this you would be redirected to the corresponding Markdown file in your repository ready for editing.

**Option B: Locate the underlying Markdown file on the repository yourself**

If the "Edit this page" button is unavailable, or if you're looking to familiarize yourself more deeply with the structure of the repository üí™, follow these steps:

1. Go to the repository.

2. Find and click on the `content` folder to open it. This is where all the Markdown files for the website content are stored.

3. Navigate through the subfolders within the `content` folder to find the file corresponding to the page you wish to edit.

> ![tip] To know exactly which file to look for, consider the URL of the page on the website. The URL should correspond to the path of the file in the repository, without the '/content' prefix.

4. Once you've found the correct file, click on it to see its contents.

5. Click on the pencil icon near the top right corner. This will open the file in edit mode.

> ![tip] **Preview your changes**
> You can switch to the "Preview" mode of the file by toggling from "Edit" -> "Preview" at the top of the file content, to see a rough visualization of your changes. Keep in mind, that the actual website may have different styling and may support additional Markdown elements that GitHub doesn't render on the preview. But if the syntax is listed in the above guide, it is good to use.

### Step 2: Save your changes

When you're happy with your edits, click on the ‚ÄúCommit changes‚Äù button. In the "Commit message" field, provide a concise summary of your changes. If necessary, you can add further explanation in the "Extended description" text field.

Then select ‚ÄúCommit directly to the main branch‚Äù.

### Step 3: See your changes live

After committing your changes, these should be pushed through to the main site.

## Summary

Congratulations! You've now learned how to edit the content on a text only page on your website.

If anything is not clear to you, or you have suggestions on how we can make this 'How to' better, please don't hesitate to let us know.

Happy editing!
