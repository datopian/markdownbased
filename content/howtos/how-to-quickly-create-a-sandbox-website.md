title: How to quickly create a sandbox website
---

By the end the end of this guide you will have set up a sandbox site to practice editing and publishing before working on any live site ðŸŽ‰

## Steps

### Step 1

For this you will need the following:

A GitHub account on https://github.com/. If you donâ€™t have one, click the link to create it.

A Vercel account on https://vercel.com/. To set one up click on Sign Up in the right hand corner and sign up using your Github account. This will create your Sandbox.

### Step 2

Go to https://github.com/datopian/flowershow

At the bottom of the page there is a "Deploy" button - click on this to be redirected to Vercel and log in using your account.

Once you have logged in, you will be redirected to the Create GitHub Repository page

Here you will see a â€˜Git Scopeâ€™, click the drop down and add your own account instead. In the right hand box create a name for the repository - the usual format is all lower case with hyphens in between words. Then select the Create button.

The website will then be deployed. This takes approximately 1 minute.

Once on the Congratulations screen, select the â€˜Continue to the dashboardâ€™ button on the right-hand side.

This will load your page with the newly entered Repository Name at the top and Production Deployment underneath. From here click on the Git Repository button on the right hand side.

This will load your Github Sandbox Interface. Now we can practice editing!
