title: How to quickly create a sandbox website
---

By the end of this guide you will have a working markdown site you can edit, which gets published automatically online ðŸŽ‰

## Prerequisites


- A GitHub account. If you donâ€™t have one, click [here](https://github.com/signup) to create it.
A Vercel account on https://vercel.com/signup. Ideally sign up using your Github account or you can choose to sign up with your email. This will create your Sandbox.

### Step 2

Go to https://github.com/datopian/flowershow

At the bottom of the page there is a "Deploy" button - click on this to be redirected to Vercel and log in using your account.

Once you have logged in, you will be redirected to the "Create GitHub Repository" page

Here you will see a â€˜Git Scopeâ€™, click the drop down and add your own account, or select it from the list. In the right hand box create a name for the repository - the usual format is all lower case with hyphens in between words. Then select the Create button.

If you've signed up to Vercel using GitHub account, you'll see "Git scope" and the field for the repo name. But if you've signed up using email, you'll see this first:

You need to select github and possibly login to your GitHub account

The website will then be deployed. This takes approximately 1 minute.

Once on the Congratulations screen, click on the preview of your sandbox website to see the live/published version.

Or, you can select the â€˜Continue to the dashboardâ€™ button on the right-hand side.

This will load your page with the newly entered Repository Name at the top and Production Deployment underneath.

From here click on the Git Repository button on the right hand side.

This will load your Github Sandbox Interface. Now we can practice editing!
